File Size Checker

Description:

This Bash script, custom_wc, checks the size of a file in bytes.

Usage
Download the Script: Download the custom_wc script from this repository.

Make the Script Executable: 

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the custom_wc script. 

1) Run the following command to make the script executable:
chmod +x custom_wc
2) Run the Script: To check the size of a file, run the script with the filename as an argument. 
For example:
./custom_wc filename.<extension>

Ensure that the script (file_size.sh) and the file you want to check are in the same directory or provide the correct path to the file.

The script assumes that the filename provided as an argument exists. If the file does not exist or if an incorrect number of arguments is provided, the script will display an error message.
